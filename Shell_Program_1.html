LINUX OS</h5></strong></p><p></p><p>  </p><p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">ADVANTAGES OF LINUX OS</span></strong><ul><li><strong>MULTIUSER</strong></li></ul></p><p><ul><li><strong>MULTIPROCESSING</strong></li></ul></p><p><ul><li><strong>MULTITASKING</strong></li></ul></p><p><ul><li><strong>MULTITHREADING</strong></li></ul></p><p><ul><li><strong>SECURITY</strong></li></ul></p><p><ul><li><strong>PORTABILITY</strong></li></ul></p><p><ul><li><strong>RELIABILITY</strong></li></ul></p><p><ul><li><strong>OPEN  SOURCE  OS</strong></li></ul></p><p></p><p></p><p> <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">MULTIUSER</span></strong></p><p> A multi-user operating system allows for multiple users to use the same computer at the same time and different times.</p><p></p><p><h6>MULTIPROCESSING</h6></p><p> An operating system capable of supporting and utilizing more than one computer processor.</p><p></p><p><h6>MULTITASKING</h6></p><p> An operating system that is capable of allowing multiple software processes to run at the same time, i.e. More than one job it will be execute at the same time.</p><p></p><p><h6>MULTITHREADING</h6></p><p> Operating systems that allow different parts of a software program to run concurrently.</p><p></p><p><h6>SECURITY</h6><ul><li>Passwords  and  Login  name  to  individual  user  for  User  label  protection</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>Read,  Write  and  Execute  permissions  to  each  file</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>File  Encryption  –  this  utility  encodes  your  file  into  an  unreadable  format</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>More  secure  for  any  type  virus</li></ul></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><h6>PORTABILITY</h6></p><p> It can be ported to almost any computer system; it is the main reason for the universal popularity of UNIX.</p><p></p><p><h6>RELIABILITY</h6><ul><li>  Reliability  can  also be a big advantage; few parts of the system can be down without  disturbing users using the other parts</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>  The  majority of Linux variants and versions are notoriously reliable and  can often run for months and years without needing to be rebooted.</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>Reliable  for  security  and  stability  reason</li></ul></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><h6>OPEN SOURCE OS</h6><ul><li>This  type  of  OS  always  available  in  your  internet  globally</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>Inner  side  modification  always  possible  in  online</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>All  types  of  device  software  are  available  from  online</li></ul></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><h6>HISTORY OF UNIX OS</h6></p><p> <strong>UNIX develop by Bell Laboratories at 1965 and it is a landmark in our Computer History</strong><ul><li>  Aim  was to develop that could serve a large community  of  user and allow them to share data if it needed</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>  In  1969 Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson develop first version of the  Multiuser OS Unix</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>  1971  Unix was ported using assembly code but it was Machine dependent and  not portable</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>  Solve  this problem Ken Thompson create a new Language “B” (High level  language) and it was not a real life programming language</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>After  some  time  Dennis  Ritchie  modified  it  to  a  new  language  named  as  “C”</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>  Finally  1973 Unix develop by this  language  “C” and act as a popular operating system</li></ul></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><h6>HISTORY OF LINUX OS</h6><ul><li>  Linux  is an operating system built by Linus Torvalds at the University of  Helsinki in 1991.</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>The  name  &quot;Linux&quot;  comes  from  the  Linux  kernel.</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>  It  is the software on a computer which enables applications and the  users to access the devices on the computer to perform some specific  function.</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>  The  Linux OS relays instructions from an application from the computer&#39;s  processor and sends the results back to the application via the  Linux OS.</li></ul></p><p><ul><li>  It  can  be installed on a different type of computers mobile phones, tablets  video game consoles, etc.</li></ul></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><h6>TOP 10 LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS</h6><ol><li><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">  </span><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;text-decoration:underline;">UBUNTU</span></strong></li></ol></p><p></p><p> Yes, Ubuntu has become the poster child for Linux these days, and no wonder--it&#39;s the most popular distro by far, garnering more than 2,200 hits per day on the Distrowatch site alone, compared with some 1,400 for Fedora, the No. 2 contender.<ol><li>  <h6>  </h6><h6> FEDORA</h6></li></ol></p><p></p><p> Fedora is the free version of Red Hat, who’s RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), has been a commercial product since 2003. Because of that close connection, Fedora is particularly strong on enterprise features, and it often offers them before RHEL does.<ol><li>  <h6>  </h6><h6> LINUX  MINT</h6></li></ol></p><p></p><p> Currently in Distrowatch&#39;s third spot in popularity, Linux Mint is an Ubuntu-based distro that was just launched in 2006. Variety of graphical tools for enhanced usability, such as mintDesktop for configuring the desktop environment, mintInstall for easier software installation and mintMenu for easier navigation.<ol><li>  <h6>  </h6><h6>  OPENSUSE</h6></li></ol></p><p></p><p> With some 1,200 hits per day on Distrowatch, openSUSE holds the No. 4 spot in popularity on the site and is also the foundation for Novell&#39;s SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server products.<ol><li>  <h6>  </h6><h6>  PCLINUXOS</h6></li></ol></p><p></p><p> Rather than GNOME, PCLinuxOS uses the KDE desktop environment and is essentially a lighter-weight version of Mandriva (see below). With good support for graphics drivers, browser plugins and media codecs, PCLinuxOS can be a good choice for beginners.<ol><li>  <h6>  </h6><h6> DEBIAN</h6></li></ol></p><p></p><p> Dating back to 1993, Debian is currently known as one of the well-tested and bug-free distros available today. Though it serves as the foundation for Ubuntu, most view Debian as a distro best-suited for those experienced with Linux. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Kali Linux</span></strong><strong> </strong>is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing.<ol><li>  <h6>  </h6><h6>  MANDRIVA</h6></li></ol></p><p></p><p> Formerly known as Mandrake, Mandriva is notable for its cutting-edge software, excellent administration suite and 64-bit edition. It was also the first major distribution to jump on the netbook bandwagon with out-of-the box support.<ol><li>  <h6>  </h6><h6>  SABAYON/GENTOO</h6></li></ol></p><p></p><p> Italian Sabayon is essentially a LiveCD version of Gentoo, which is known for allowing users to individually optimize each component. Both are considered advanced Linux distributions aimed primarily at experienced users.<ol><li>  <h6>  </h6><h6> ARCH  LINUX...  PLUS  SLACKWARE</h6></li></ol></p><p></p><p> Arch is another package aimed primarily at experienced users interested in tweaking and optimizing their systems. Though not in the top 10 currently, Slackware is similarly oriented toward Linux gurus.<ol><li>  <h6>  </h6><h6> PUPPY  LINUX...  PLUS  DSL</h6></li></ol></p><p></p><p> Last on Distrowatch&#39;s top 10 currently is Puppy Linux, a compact distro that&#39;s ideal for older hardware and situations where computing resources are minimal. The whole OS is small enough to run directly from system RAM, so applications start quickly and respond to user input instantly.</p><p></p><p><h6>FEATURES OF UNIX OS</h6></p><p>  ◇ Multi-user,   multitasking   operating   system</p><p></p><p>  ◇ It   can   be   used   as   the   master   control   program   in   workstations   and   servers.</p><p></p><p>  ◇ Hundreds   of   commercial   applications   are   available</p><p></p><p>  ◇    In   its heydays, UNIX was rapidly   adopted   and became the standard OS in universities.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><h6>LIMITATIONS OF UNIX</h6></p><p>  ◇ The   unfriendly,   terse,   inconsistent,   and   non-mnemonic   user   interface</p><p></p><p>  ◇    Unix   OS is designed for a slow computer system, so you can&#39;t expect fast   performance.</p><p></p><p>  ◇ Shell   interface   can   be   treacherous   because   typing   mistake   can   destroy   files.</p><p></p><p>  ◇ Versions   on   various   machines   are   slightly   different,   so   it   lacks   consistency.</p><p></p><p>  ◇    Unix   does not provide any assured hardware interrupt response time, so   it does not support real time response time systems.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><h6>FEATURES OF LINUX</h6></p><p>  ◇ Support   multitasking</p><p></p><p>  ◇    Programs   consist of one or more processes, and each process have one or more   threads</p><p></p><p>  ◇ It   can   easily   co-exists   along   with   other   Operating   systems.</p><p></p><p>  ◇ It   can   run   multiple   user   programs</p><p></p><p>  ◇ Individual   accounts   are   protected   because   of   appropriate   authorization</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><h6>LIMITATION OF LINUX</h6></p><p>  ◇ Linux   is   a   replica   of   UNIX   but   does   not   use   its   code.</p><p></p><p>  ◇ There&#39;s   no   standard   edition   of   Linux</p><p></p><p>  ◇    Linux   has patchier support for drivers which may result in malfunctioning   of the entire system.</p><p></p><p>  ◇ Linux   is,   for   new   users   at   least,   not   as   easy   to   use   as   Windows.</p><p></p><p>  ◇    Many   of the programs we are using for Windows will only run on Linux   only with the help of a complicated emulator. For example.   Microsoft Office.</p><p></p><p>  ◇    Linux   is best suitable for a corporate user. It&#39;s much harder to   introduce in a home setting.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p><h6>KEY DIFFERENCE UNIX &amp; LINUX</h6></p><p>  ◇    Linux   source code is available to the general public whereas, in UNIX,   the source code is proprietary.</p><p></p><p>  ◇    UNIX   OS was created in the late 1960s at AT&amp;T Bell Labs whereas   Linux is an operating system built by Linus Torvalds at the   University of Helsinki in 1991.</p><p></p><p>  ◇ Linux   is   a   clone   of   Unix</p><p></p><p>  ◇ Linux   default   shell   is   BASH   while   the   Unix   shell   is   Bourne   Shell.</p><p></p><p>  ◇    Linux   threat detection and solution are very fast while Unix users   require longer wait times to get the proper bug fixing patch.</p><p></p><p>  ◇    Important   versions of Linux are Redhat, Ubuntu, OpenSuse, Solaris, whereas   important versions of UNIX are HP-UX, AIS, BSD, etc.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p></div>
