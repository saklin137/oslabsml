<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Scheduling Algorithm</h1><br/><p><strong><h1>Scheduling Algorithm</h1></strong></p><p>CPU scheduling is a process used by the operating system to decide which task or process gets to use the CPU at a particular time. This is important because a CPU can only handle one task at a time, but there are usually many tasks that need to be processed. The following are different purposes of a CPU scheduling time.</p><p></p><p>Maximize the CPU utilization</p><p>Minimize the response and waiting time of the process.</p><p></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">What is the Need for a CPU Scheduling Algorithm?</span></strong></p><p></p><p>CPU scheduling is the process of deciding which process will own the CPU to use while another process is suspended. The main function of CPU scheduling is to ensure that whenever the CPU remains idle, the OS has at least selected one of the processes available in the ready-to-use line.</p><p>Terminologies Used in CPU Scheduling</p><p></p><p>    <strong>Arrival Time</strong>: The time at which the process arrives in the ready queue.</p><p>    <strong>Completion Time</strong>: The time at which the process completes its execution.</p><p>    <strong>Burst Time</strong>: Time required by a process for CPU execution.</p><p>    <strong>Turn Around Time</strong>: Time Difference between completion time and arrival time. </p><p></p><p>    Turn Around Time = Completion Time  –  Arrival Time</p><p></p><p>    <strong>Waiting Time(W.T)</strong>: Time Difference between turn around time and burst time.</p><p></p><p>    Waiting Time = Turn Around Time  –  Burst Time</p></div>
